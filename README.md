# Chemical-Images-to-Molecular-Structure-texts

## Introduction
This repository contains extensive analysis of Bristol-Myers Squibb Molecular Translation. As part of a competition conducted on Kaggle, Bristol Myers Squibb wanted a solution to convert millions of images containing chemical compounds to their respective International Chemical Identifier formula (InChI).

## Background and Problem
In this experimental world, technology has provided various innovative tools; however, for organic chemists, the most accessible tools are still notebook and pen. They draw sub-atomic or molecular work with the structural notation used for an extended period. Several years of scanned documents can’t be searched for compound depictions by the scientist. The main goal of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Molecular Translation competition was to accelerate the research and development efforts and elevate organic chemist access to chemical research through image recognition of optical chemical structures using a machine learning algorithm. 
In this project, we’ll convert chemical images to the molecular structure annotated by InChI text.
